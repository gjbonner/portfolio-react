      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Iâ€™m a Full Stack developer with a passion for building easy to use, state of the art websites and applications implementing
       clean and efficient code. With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a background in data analytics,
       I discovered web development through my enthusiasm for technology, curiosity of how things work,
       and my love for the idea of being given a blank canvas, a problem and countless ways to solve it! I bring strong skills in collaborative and agile development that help team-driven, tightly knit companies efficiently develop current and fit for market solutions.</p>
