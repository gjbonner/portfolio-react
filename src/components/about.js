      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Iâ€™m a Full Stack developer with a passion for building easy to use, state of the art websites and applications implementing
       clean and efficient code. With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a background in data analytics,
       I discovered web development through my enthusiasm for technology, curiosity of how things work,
       and my love for the idea of being given a blank canvas, a problem and countless ways to solve it!
     I bring strong skills in collaborative and agile development that help team-driven,
     tightly knit companies efficiently develop current and fit for market solutions.<br/><br/>

     I love to cook and have even built a food oriented app which you can see in my portfolio! It is now obvious why it suits me
     so well! It is a deconstruction of a problem and engineering a solution to the problem to get a result. Another big interest of mine
     is building computers and playing around with IoT.
